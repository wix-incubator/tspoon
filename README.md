# tspoon
Customizing TypeScript semantics by introducing a visitors engine.
### who should use this tool
Tspoon will help you define a powerful build-time [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) on top of Typescript. This means that the semantics that the DSL introduces are already evaluated by the time the code executes, saving precious runtime latency and errors.
Tspoon also enables custom build-time validations, which unlike tools such as tsLint, also supports pre-validation code changes, allowing the developer to bypass otherwise unavoidable TypeScript diagnostics.
Tspoon uses [Typescript's compiler API](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API) to allow pluggable pieces of logic (called ```visitor```) to modify the [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) before invoking the Typescript transpiler.

### how to write a visitor
A visitor is an instance of the visitor interface:
```typescript
// from src/visitor.ts
interface Visitor {
	filter(node: ts.Node) : boolean;
	visit(node: ts.Node, context: VisitorContext): void;
}
```
Consider for example the following visitor:
```javascript
// from example-poc/deletePrivate.js
{
	filter : function filter(node){
		return node.kind === ts.SyntaxKind.PropertyDeclaration
			&& node.modifiers
			&& node.modifiers.some(function(m){
				return m.kind === ts.SyntaxKind.PrivateKeyword;
			});
	},
	visit: function visit(node, context) {
		context.replace(node.getStart(), node.getEnd(), '');
		context.reportDiag(node, ts.DiagnosticCategory.Message, 'deleted field "' + node.getText()+'"', false);
	}
}
```
This visitor only operates on nodes representing property declarations which have the ```private``` modifier. When such a node is encountered, it is deleted from the source code, and a diagnostic message notifying the delete action is emitted.
### how to use tspoon in your project
Currently, Tspoon exposes only a programmatic API. Meaning, it is used by other javacript code invoking it's ```transpile``` and ```validate``` methods.
#### tspon.transpile(content, config)
content is a string containing the code to transpile, and config defines the visitors and transpilation parameters.
The result is an instance of the TranspilerOutput interface, containing the transpiled code, a source map describing all changes done to the code, the diagnostics generated by the visitors and Typescript, and whether the operation failed or not.
```typescript
// from src/transpile.ts
interface TranspilerOutput {
	code: string,
	sourceMap: RawSourceMap,
	diags: ts.Diagnostic[],
	halted: boolean
}
```
a usage example can be found in the ```example-poc``` folder:
```javascript
// from example-poc/build.js
var config = {
    sourceFileName: 'src.ts',
    visitors: ... // insert visitors here
};
var sourceCode = fs.readFileSync(...);
var transpilerOut = tspoon.transpile(sourceCode, config);
...
fs.writeFileSync(path.join(__dirname, 'src.js'), transpilerOut.code, {encoding:'utf8'});
```

#### tspon.validate()
